#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software sytems. 
Its important in the technology industry is that engineering plays a crucial role by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of morden life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The develpment of programming languages.
The establishment of software engineering as a descipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements, Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design, Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation, Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing, conducting variuos tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment, Realising the software to the users or customers.
Maintainance, Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall, is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design, implementatin.
Agile is an approach focused on flexibility, collabaration and responding to change.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer, Writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer, Ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager, Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Develpment Environments: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. For example, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Intelli,
Version Control Systems: Software tools for trading changes to source code and cordinating work among team members like Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leadingng to scope creep and projec delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to diliver software products on schedule can results in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Occures from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt csn impede future development efforts and increase maintainance costs.
Strategies for overcomimg challengies include effective communictatio, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessments of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing, Testing individual componemts or units of code like functions, methods or classes. Its importance is to ensure that each unit funtions correctly.
Intergration Testing is the type of testing how units interact with each other, its importance is that it varifies data correctly between units.
System Testing, Testing the entire system, including hardware and softeware, to ensure it meets requirements. 
Acceptance Testing, Testing the entire product or system to ensure it meets requirements and user expactations.Its importance is to confirms the product meets business requirements and user stories.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Propmt Engineering is all about crafting quaestions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt Engineering helps to make your quetions clear and specific so AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
You can ask AI what is coding ? but to make it more precise you can ask Give me the explanation of coding in simple terms and explain what is mostly used in coding.
Prompt is more effective because it gives you the exaact information that you need rather then getting all the unnecessary information that will end up confusing you.
